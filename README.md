QMK config for my Sofle RGB keyboard.

> [!NOTE]
> I have switched to using a [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) as my main keyboard.
> I will keep this repo here but it is unlikely I will make further updates to it.
> You can find my Corne config at [coko7/crkbd](https://github.com/Coko7/crkbd).
